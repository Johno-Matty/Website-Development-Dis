# Website-Development-Dis
A website created for my dissertation in web development around assisting football training sessions. I scored 73% on my project however, the website is
currently incomplete.

If you wish to run this website, you must download it into your 'htdocs' folder in xampp, ensure that the xampp server is sqitched on along with SQL
accounts can be created on the website or on the SQL server. Drills can only be created on the server.
